A starter project to test infrared on an arduino card 

it uses : Arduino Uno / Infrared reciever TSOP1838 / Servo motor SG90 / Distance sensor GP2Y0A21YK (obstacle detector) / Photodiodes(line follower mode) Also it needs an infrared remote control or even a smartphone's.

How to use : 
When start you configure key bindings then you run it on { manual mode or self-acting mode (by pressing the first configured button)}

PS : In the slef-acting mode moving algorithm is commented so you can test your car before.
